This project was developed to display the use of DOM manipulation:

For this project, I created a photo album where users are allowed to select images from their documents and upload them to the page. 
A login form was created to display HTML attribute validation and DOM event-based validation.
To fulfil BOM requirement, Add caption button was added to request user PROMPT and update the caption of each image. Also, an alert is flagged if the file selected when uploading a photo is not an image.
Elements are dynamically created when buttons in the navbar are clicked. Multiple event listeners were deployed for functionality.
