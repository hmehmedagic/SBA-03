This project was developed to display the use of DOM manipulation:

For this project, I created a photo album where users are allowed to select images from their documents and upload them to the page.
The Navbar topmenu buttons and submenu buttons are dynamically allocated using DOM manipulation.
A login form was created to display HTML attribute validation and DOM event-based validation for forms.
To fulfil BOM requirement, Add caption button was added to request user PROMPT and update the caption of each image. Also, an alert is flagged if the file selected when uploading a photo is not an image.
Elements are dynamically created when buttons in the navbar are clicked. Multiple event listeners were deployed for functionality.

How to Use:
    User can click on the about button to change the innerHTML of the main.

    User can click the photo album button then add photo to select an image from their files and upload it to the webpage. After uploading of an image or images, user is granted the ability to add a caption or remove an image from their respective buttons.

    User can click on account followed by log in to pull up a modal of the login form.
