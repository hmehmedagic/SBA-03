This project was developed to display the use of DOM manipulation:

For this project, I created a photo album where users are allowed to select images from their documents and upload them to the page. 
A login form was created to display HTML attribute validation and DOM event-based validation.
A menu item for BOM was added to fulfil the requirements of the project. I could not find a reason to use it within the scope of this project.
Elements are dynamically created when buttons in the navbar are clicked. Multiple event listeners were deployed for functionality.
